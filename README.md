# CPCS212-Government-Welfare-Expenditure
In this Project, we are given a data set that has two sections, "year" which starts from the year 1985-1995, and "expenditures in billions of dollars" which is the value of the expenditure of each year. We will solve this APP by using three different methods Linear extrapolation method, Larange polynomial method, and least square quadratic method. We can estimate the value that would be in the 1980 year, compare the approximate answers from each method with the given value (actual expenditures) which is 492 billion dollars.The best method for expecting a tax for a previous year by several posterior years is the Linear extrapolation. The result of Linear extrapolation is 476 billion which is close to the amount actually spent is 492 billion.
